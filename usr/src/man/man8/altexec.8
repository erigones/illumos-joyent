.TH ALTEXEC 8 "May 1, 2023"
.
.SH "NAME"
\fBaltexec\fR \-\- Platform commands supplied by pkgsrc
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.
.nf
/usr/bin/altexec
.
.fi
.
.P
This command should not be run directly\. This command should only be called
where \fBarg[0]\fR is the name of another command to be \fBexec(2)\fR\'d\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is a generic wrapper for supplying lesser\-used commands via pkgsrc rather
than directly in the platform image\. This allows preserving space in the
ram disk while also extending the platform image with additional commands\. The
primary target for this is shells and interpreters\.
.
.P
This works both with base/minimal zone images as well as pkgsrc\-tools installed
in the global zone\. If both are installed, \fB/opt/tools\fR will be preferred over \fB/opt/local\fR\|\.
.
.P
Note: This does not allow operators to arbitrarily extend the SmartOS platform
image because that would require writing to \fB/usr/bin\fR, which is read\-only\.
Rather, SmartOS itself provides hooks for specific commands that can be
satisfied using pkgsrc\.
.
.P
The following platform commands can be satisfied using pkgsrc:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
csh (by installing tcsh)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
tcsh
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
zsh
.
.P
Thus, if \fBtcsh\fR is installed via pkgsrc, then you can call \fB/usr/bin/csh\fR,
which would then invoke \fB/opt/{tools,local}/bin/tcsh\fR\|\. This will allow, for
example, \fB/usr/bin/csh\fR to be used as a script interpreter or as an LDAP user\'s
shell in either the global zone or non\-global zones without any additional
special handling\.
.

.SH INTERFACE STABILITY
\fBaltexec\fR is a private interface and may change at any time.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.
.nf
  exec(2), shells(5), csh(1), tcsh(1), zsh(1), pkgin(1)
.
.fi
.
.SH "NOTES"
The SmartOS platform image is currently mosty composed of 32\-bit binaries\.
Packages installed via pkgsrc will be 64\-bit if using pkgsrc\-tools (in the
global zone) or a base\-64/minimal\-64 zone image\.
