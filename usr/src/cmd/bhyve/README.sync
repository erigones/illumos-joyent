    bhyve hostbridge: Rename "device" property to "devid".

    "device" is already used as the generic PCI-level name of the device
    model to use (e.g. "hostbridge").  The result was that parsing
    "hostbridge" as an integer failed and the host bridge used a device ID
    of 0.  The EFI ROM asserts that the device ID of the hostbridge is not
    0, so booting with the current EFI ROM was failing during the ROM
    boot.

Divergence Notes:

A previous sync skipped commit 0ff7076bdbc6dae5ea44c0acdb567e1cede199d1 which
introduced a generic backend functionality to network devices.  Without that in
place, subsequent updates reflect the absence of that subsystem.  Integrating
net backends has not been a priority, given the common use of viona on illumos.

The draft Save/Restore functionality, added in FreeBSD commit
483d953a86a2507355f8287c5107dc827a0ff516, has not been synced into illumos bhyve
yet.  It is not built by default in FreeBSD, so we're not interested in taking
it until it successfully endures more in-depth testing.

The VirtFS filesystem sharing feature, added in FreeBSD commit
100353cfbf882e23c911300ebd0cb458bd3ee975, has not been synced into illumos bhyve
yet.  It depends on the userland lib9p which needs a fair amount of work to
build and run on illumos. The integration of this feature is being tracked in
https://www.illumos.org/issues/13380

The stub usr/src/compat/bhyve/stdatomic.h file only includes enough glue
to satisfy the use of <stdatomic.h> in usr/src/cmd/bhyve/rfb.c, and in
particular assumes that atomic variables are sized as an int. If other bhyve
pieces start using stdatomic.h, this will need enhancing.
